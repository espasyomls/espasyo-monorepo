# Feature Specification: Standardize Docker Ports

**Feature Branch**: `004-standardize-the-docker`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "standardize the docker ports to avoid conflicts. a range must be allocated to a certain group of services in the containers. for example, frontend will use 3000 block while microservices will use 4000, edsl will use 5000, grafana or prometheus will use the 6000 block, aws services will use 7000 block,etc, I do not know what else needs a block. these blocks once identified and standardized, must be implemented across the project."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: What additional port blocks should be allocated for the remaining service types (Databases, Development Tools, Infrastructure), and how should the Grafana port conflict (wants 3001, conflicts with User Profile Service) be resolved? ‚Üí A: Databases: 8000 block, Dev Tools: 9000 block, Infrastructure: 2000 block, Move Grafana to 6001

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Espasyo MLS project, I need standardized Docker port allocations so that when I start multiple services locally, there are no port conflicts and I can easily identify which service is running on which port.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple Docker services are running simultaneously, **When** I check port usage, **Then** each service uses a port within its designated block without conflicts
2. **Given** a new service is added to the project, **When** it needs a port assignment, **Then** it gets assigned to the appropriate block based on its service type
3. **Given** the port standardization is implemented, **When** I deploy services, **Then** the same port blocks are used across all environments (development, staging, production)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a service block runs out of available ports?
- How does the system handle services that need multiple ports (e.g., databases with different interfaces)?
- What happens when an existing service is already using a port outside its designated block?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allocate port blocks to service groups to prevent conflicts
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign frontend services to the 3000 block (3000-3999)
- **FR-003**: System MUST assign microservices to the 4000 block (4000-4999)
- **FR-004**: System MUST assign eDSL services to the 5000 block (5000-5999)
- **FR-005**: System MUST assign monitoring services (Grafana, Prometheus) to the 6000 block (6000-6999)
- **FR-006**: System MUST assign AWS services to the 7000 block (7000-7999)
- **FR-007**: System MUST assign database services to the 8000 block (8000-8999)
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign development tools to the 9000 block (9000-9999)
- **FR-009**: System MUST assign infrastructure services to the 2000 block (2000-2999)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure port standardization is implemented across all Docker compose files in the project
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide documentation of port block assignments for all service types
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that no port conflicts exist within assigned blocks

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Port Block**: Represents a range of ports allocated to a service group (e.g., 3000-3999 for frontend, 8000-8999 for databases, 9000-9999 for development tools, 2000-2999 for infrastructure)
- **Service Group**: Categorization of services by type (frontend, microservices, monitoring, AWS services, databases, development tools, infrastructure)
- **Port Assignment**: Mapping of specific ports to individual services within their designated blocks
