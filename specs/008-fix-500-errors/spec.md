## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: What are the expected data volume and scale assumptions for users and agents? → A: Support 10,000 active users with 2,000 concurrent agents
- Q: What security and privacy requirements apply to agent profile data? → A: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- Q: What are the reliability and availability targets for the API services? → A: 99.5% uptime with automatic recovery within 30 seconds
- Q: What observability requirements are needed for monitoring and debugging? → A: Structured logging with error tracking and performance metrics
- Q: What technical constraints or frameworks are we using for the backend services? → A: Go microservices with PostgreSQL database

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent Can Access Dashboard Without Errors (Priority: P1)

Authenticated agents should be able to access their dashboard without encountering 500 Internal Server Error when the system attempts to fetch their profile data.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical blocking issue preventing authenticated users from using the application. Users can log in successfully but cannot access their dashboard due to API failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as an agent, navigating to the dashboard, and verifying that profile data loads without 500 errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated agent user, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** the agent profile API calls should return successful responses (200) instead of 500 errors
2. **Given** an authenticated agent user, **When** the system fetches user profile data, **Then** the user service API should return successful responses instead of 500 errors
3. **Given** an authenticated agent user, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** agent-specific data should load and display correctly

---

### User Story 2 - System Provides Meaningful Error Messages (Priority: P2)

When API calls fail, users should see appropriate error messages instead of generic 500 errors.

**Why this priority**: While fixing the root cause is P1, providing better error handling ensures users understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating API failures and verifying that users see helpful error messages instead of blank screens or generic errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an API call fails with a 500 error, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** users should see a user-friendly error message explaining the issue
2. **Given** agent profile data cannot be loaded, **When** the dashboard renders, **Then** the interface should gracefully handle missing data with appropriate fallbacks

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user service is down but agent service is working? → System MUST display available agent data with user section showing "Profile data temporarily unavailable" and retry option
- How does the system handle partial data loading (user data loads but agent data fails)? → System MUST display available user data with agent section showing "Agent profile incomplete - contact support" message
- What happens when database connections fail during API calls? → System MUST return 503 Service Unavailable with automatic retry logic and user notification
- How does the system behave when JWT tokens expire during API calls? → System MUST return 401 Unauthorized and redirect to login with "Session expired" message

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST return successful (200) responses for GET /api/v1/agents?userId={id} requests when valid agent data exists
- **FR-002**: System MUST return successful (200) responses for GET /api/v1/users/{id} requests when valid user data exists
- **FR-003**: Agent profile API endpoints MUST handle database queries without throwing unhandled exceptions
- **FR-004**: User profile API endpoints MUST handle database queries without throwing unhandled exceptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide appropriate error responses (4xx) instead of 500 errors for client-side issues. Error responses MUST include error code, user-friendly message, and optional details field following the format: `{"success": false, "error": {"code": "ERROR_TYPE", "message": "User-friendly description"}}`
- **FR-006**: System MUST log detailed error information for debugging 500 errors while returning user-friendly messages to clients
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate API requests using JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. JWT tokens MUST be validated for HS256 signature algorithm, 24-hour expiration, and required claims (sub, role, exp, iat). Invalid tokens MUST return 401 errors, expired tokens MUST return 401 errors, and missing tokens MUST return 401 errors.
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement structured logging with error tracking and performance metrics for observability

*Technical Context: Backend services implemented using Go microservices with PostgreSQL database*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents authenticated users with basic profile information (name, email, role, verification status). Expected scale: 10,000 active users
- **Agent**: Represents agent-specific profile data linked to a user account. Expected scale: 2,000 concurrent agents
- **API Response**: Standardized response format with success/error status and data payload

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Authenticated agents can access dashboard without 500 errors in 100% of test cases
- **SC-002**: Agent and user profile API endpoints return 200 responses for valid requests within 2 seconds (p95 latency under normal load)
- **SC-003**: System provides meaningful error messages to users when API calls fail, improving user experience by 80%. Error messages MUST include error code, user-friendly description, and actionable guidance (e.g., "Please try again" or "Contact support if issue persists")
- **SC-004**: API services maintain 99.5% uptime with automatic recovery within 30 seconds of failures
