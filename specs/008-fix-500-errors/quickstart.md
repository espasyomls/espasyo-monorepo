# Quickstart: Fix 500 Errors in Agent Profile API

**Feature**: Fix 500 Errors in Agent Profile API
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: P1 (Critical - Blocks user access)

## Overview

This feature fixes 500 Internal Server Error responses from agent profile API endpoints. The issue occurs when authenticated agents try to access their dashboard, causing API calls to `/api/v1/agents?userId={id}` and `/api/v1/users/{id}` to fail.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.x development environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Access to espasyo-backend and espasyo-frontend repositories
- Valid JWT authentication setup

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Error Handling (Priority: High)

1. **Update Agent Service Error Handling**
   ```bash
   cd espasyo-backend/repos/microservices/svc-agent-go
   ```

   - Implement custom error types in `internal/models/errors.go`
   - Add error recovery middleware in `internal/middleware/recovery.go`
   - Update agent handlers to use structured error responses
   - Add database connection health checks

2. **Update User Service Error Handling**
   ```bash
   cd espasyo-backend/repos/edsl
   ```

   - Implement custom error types in `internal/models/errors.go`
   - Add error recovery middleware in `internal/middleware/recovery.go`
   - Update user handlers to use structured error responses
   - Add database connection health checks

3. **Database Connection Improvements**
   - Configure connection pooling in database packages
   - Add connection health monitoring
   - Implement automatic reconnection logic
   - Add prepared statements for common queries

### Phase 2: API Response Standardization (Priority: High)

1. **Implement Consistent Response Format**
   - Create shared response types in both services
   - Update all endpoints to use standardized success/error responses
   - Add proper HTTP status code mapping

2. **JWT Authentication Middleware**
   - Ensure JWT validation middleware is properly configured
   - Add role-based access control checks
   - Implement proper error responses for auth failures

### Phase 3: Logging and Monitoring (Priority: Medium)

1. **Implement Structured Logging**
   - Add structured logging to all handlers
   - Include request IDs for tracing
   - Log errors with appropriate detail levels
   - Separate application and access logs

2. **Add Health Check Endpoints**
   - Implement `/health` endpoints for both services
   - Add database connectivity checks
   - Include service dependency health status

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Priority: High)

1. **Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   cd espasyo-backend/repos/microservices/svc-agent-go
   go test ./...
   ```

   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test database connection failures
   - Test invalid input validation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test API endpoints with various scenarios
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test database connectivity issues

3. **Frontend Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   cd espasyo-frontend
   npm run test
   ```

   - Test error handling in API clients
   - Test dashboard loading with various error conditions

## Validation Checklist

### Backend Validation
- [ ] Agent service returns 200 for valid agent queries
- [ ] User service returns 200 for valid user queries
- [ ] Both services return appropriate 4xx errors for invalid requests
- [ ] No unhandled exceptions cause 500 errors
- [ ] Database connections are properly pooled and monitored
- [ ] JWT authentication works correctly
- [ ] Structured logging is implemented

### Frontend Validation
- [ ] Dashboard loads successfully for authenticated agents
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] API client handles errors gracefully

### Performance Validation
- [ ] API responses return within 2 seconds
- [ ] Services can handle 2,000 concurrent agent requests
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Database connections are efficiently managed

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build and Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose -f espasyo-backend/docker-compose.local.yml up -d

   # Run tests
   cd espasyo-backend && go test ./...
   cd espasyo-frontend && npm run test

   # Test the fix
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" \
        "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/agents?userId=test-user-id"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Deploy backend services to staging environment
   - Verify API endpoints work correctly
   - Test dashboard functionality

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy with zero-downtime strategy
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Rollback plan ready if issues arise

## Monitoring and Alerting

After deployment, monitor:
- API error rates (target: <1% 500 errors)
- Response times (target: <2 seconds p95)
- Database connection pool utilization
- Authentication success rates

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:
1. Rollback backend services to previous version
2. Verify frontend compatibility with old API
3. Investigate root cause before re-deployment
4. Update monitoring alerts based on lessons learned

## Success Criteria Verification

- [ ] Authenticated agents can access dashboard without 500 errors (100% success rate)
- [ ] API endpoints return responses within 2 seconds
- [ ] Services maintain 99.5% uptime
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] All tests pass with Six Sigma quality standards
