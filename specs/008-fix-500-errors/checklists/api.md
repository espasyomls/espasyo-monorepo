# API Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: Fix 500 Errors in Agent Profile API
**Checklist Type**: API Requirements Quality
**Focus**: Error handling, response formats, authentication requirements
**Depth**: Lightweight (15-20 items)
**Audience**: Author (self-review during requirements writing)
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Spec**: [link to spec.md](../spec.md)
**Plan**: [link to plan.md](../plan.md)

**Purpose**: Unit tests for API requirements - validates whether API specifications are complete, clear, and ready for implementation. This checklist evaluates requirement quality, not implementation behavior.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes (database errors, auth failures, invalid parameters)? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are response format requirements specified for both success and error cases across all endpoints? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are authentication requirements documented for all protected API endpoints? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are parameter validation requirements defined for all query/path parameters? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are timeout and retry requirements specified for external service dependencies? [Completeness, Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 - Is the standardized error response format clearly defined with specific field requirements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are HTTP status code requirements explicitly specified for each error condition? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is JWT authentication failure handling clearly defined with specific error codes? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK009 - Are database connection failure requirements quantified with specific timeout values? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the difference between 4xx and 5xx error requirements clearly specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 - Are error response formats consistent between agent and user service APIs? [Consistency, Contracts]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are authentication requirements consistent across all protected endpoints? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 - Are success response structures consistent between different API operations? [Consistency, Contracts]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are parameter naming conventions consistent across all API endpoints? [Consistency, Contracts]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 - Are success criteria measurable with specific response codes and timing requirements? [Measurability, Spec SC-001, SC-002]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are error handling success criteria defined with specific user experience improvements? [Measurability, Spec SC-004]
- [ ] CHK017 - Are uptime requirements quantified with specific percentages and recovery times? [Measurability, Spec SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 - Are requirements defined for partial data loading scenarios (user data loads but agent data fails)? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are requirements specified for concurrent user access scenarios? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK020 - Are requirements defined for database connection pool exhaustion scenarios? [Coverage, Gap]
