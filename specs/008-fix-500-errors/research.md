# Research: Fix 500 Errors in Agent Profile API

**Feature**: Fix 500 Errors in Agent Profile API
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Research Focus**: Go microservices error handling, PostgreSQL query patterns, JWT middleware, and API response standards

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Go Microservices Error Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Implement structured error handling with custom error types and middleware recovery

**Rationale**: Go's standard approach uses custom error types that implement the error interface, combined with middleware for centralized error handling. This provides consistent error responses while maintaining detailed logging for debugging.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Panic/recover: Too disruptive, can crash services
- Generic error wrapping: Less structured than custom types
- Third-party libraries: Adds complexity without clear benefits

**Implementation Pattern**:
```go
type APIError struct {
    Code    string `json:"code"`
    Message string `json:"message"`
    Status  int    `json:"-"`
}

func (e *APIError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s: %s", e.Code, e.Message)
}
```

### 2. PostgreSQL Connection and Query Error Handling

**Decision**: Use database/sql with connection pooling and proper error classification

**Rationale**: Go's database/sql package provides robust connection pooling and error handling. Errors should be classified (connection vs query vs constraint violations) for appropriate responses.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ORM libraries (GORM): Adds abstraction but can hide important details
- Raw SQL only: More control but more boilerplate
- Third-party connection poolers: Unnecessary complexity

**Best Practices**:
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Implement connection health checks
- Handle constraint violations gracefully
- Log detailed errors while returning user-friendly messages

### 3. JWT Authentication Middleware in Go

**Decision**: Use jwt-go library with custom middleware for role-based access control

**Rationale**: The jwt-go library is mature and well-tested. Custom middleware allows for proper RBAC implementation and error handling specific to authentication failures.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Built-in JWT handling: Less flexible for custom claims
- Third-party auth libraries: Overkill for microservice needs
- External auth services: Adds network latency

**Security Considerations**:
- Validate token expiration
- Check role permissions per endpoint
- Log authentication failures without exposing sensitive data
- Use secure token storage patterns

### 4. API Response Formatting Standards

**Decision**: Implement consistent JSON response structure with error and success formats

**Rationale**: Standardized response formats improve API usability and error handling on the client side. Separate success and error response structures provide clear contracts.

**Response Patterns**:
```json
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input parameters"
  }
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- HTTP status codes only: Insufficient for detailed error information
- Custom formats per endpoint: Inconsistent API experience
- GraphQL: Overkill for REST-based microservices

### 5. Logging Best Practices for Go Services

**Decision**: Use structured logging with log levels and context

**Rationale**: Structured logging enables better observability and debugging. Different log levels allow for appropriate verbosity in different environments.

**Implementation**:
- Use a logging library like logrus or zap
- Include request IDs for tracing
- Log errors with context but avoid sensitive data
- Separate application logs from access logs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Standard log package: Lacks structure and levels
- Multiple logging libraries: Increases complexity
- External logging services: Adds infrastructure dependencies

### 6. Database Connection Pooling and Recovery

**Decision**: Configure database/sql connection pool with health checks and automatic recovery

**Rationale**: Connection pooling improves performance and resource usage. Health checks and recovery mechanisms ensure service reliability.

**Configuration**:
- Set maximum open connections
- Configure connection lifetime
- Implement health check endpoints
- Handle connection failures gracefully

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No connection pooling: Poor performance under load
- External connection poolers: Unnecessary abstraction
- Database-specific pooling: Less portable

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Error Handling**: Custom error types with middleware recovery provide structured, consistent error responses
2. **Database**: Connection pooling with proper error classification ensures reliable data access
3. **Authentication**: JWT middleware with RBAC provides secure, performant authorization
4. **API Design**: Standardized JSON responses improve client integration and debugging
5. **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels enables effective monitoring
6. **Reliability**: Connection pooling and health checks ensure 99.5% uptime targets

## Implementation Recommendations

- Implement custom error types for all services
- Use middleware for centralized error handling and logging
- Configure database connection pools with health monitoring
- Standardize API response formats across all endpoints
- Implement structured logging with request tracing
- Add health check endpoints for monitoring
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper JWT validation and role checking
