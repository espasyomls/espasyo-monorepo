# Feature Specification: Create 3 Dashboard Pages

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-3-dashboard`
**Created**: October 5, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create 3 dashboard pages: first the administrator dashboard; second the agent dashboard; third the user dashboard."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What specific administrative functions should be available on the administrator dashboard? ‚Üí A: System metrics, user management, content moderation, platform settings
- Q: What specific agent tools should be available on the agent dashboard? ‚Üí A: Property listing management, client communication, analytics, commission tracking
- Q: What specific user features should be available on the user dashboard? ‚Üí A: Saved searches, favorite properties, account settings, viewing history
- Q: How should user roles be determined and managed in the system? ‚Üí A: Self-selection during registration with admin approval
- Q: What should happen when a user tries to access a dashboard they're not authorized for? ‚Üí A: Show generic error message without revealing role information

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system user, I want to access a personalized dashboard after logging in so that I can view and manage information relevant to my role and activities in the real estate platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator is logged in, **When** they navigate to their dashboard, **Then** they should see administrative controls and system-wide metrics
2. **Given** a real estate agent is logged in, **When** they navigate to their dashboard, **Then** they should see their property listings, client interactions, and performance metrics
3. **Given** a regular user is logged in, **When** they navigate to their dashboard, **Then** they should see their saved properties, search history, and account preferences

### Edge Cases
- When a user tries to access a dashboard they're not authorized for, the system MUST show a generic error message without revealing role information
- How does the system handle users with multiple roles (e.g., agent who is also an administrator)?
- What dashboard should be shown for users who haven't completed their profile setup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated dashboard for administrators with system management capabilities
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a dedicated dashboard for real estate agents with property and client management tools
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a dedicated dashboard for regular users with property search and account management features
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically redirect users to their appropriate dashboard based on their role after login
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure users can only access dashboards appropriate to their assigned roles and permissions
- **FR-006**: Each dashboard MUST display personalized content relevant to the user's role and recent activities
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain consistent navigation and layout across all dashboard types

*Areas needing clarification:*
- **FR-008**: Administrator dashboard MUST include system metrics, user management, content moderation, and platform settings
- **FR-009**: Agent dashboard MUST include property listing management, client communication, analytics, and commission tracking
- **FR-010**: User dashboard MUST include saved searches, favorite properties, account settings, and viewing history
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle role-based access control with self-selection during registration and admin approval

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents system users with role-based access (Administrator, Agent, Regular User)
- **Dashboard**: Role-specific interface containing relevant widgets, metrics, and navigation options
- **User Role**: Defines permissions and determines which dashboard and features are accessible; assigned through self-selection during registration with administrator approval
