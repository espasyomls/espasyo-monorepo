# Research: Create 3 Dashboard Pages

**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Feature**: 002-create-3-dashboard
**Researcher**: Implementation Planning Agent

## Research Questions & Findings

### 1. Next.js App Router Dashboard Patterns
**Question**: What are the best practices for implementing role-based dashboards in Next.js 15 App Router?

**Findings**:
- Use dynamic routes with role-based middleware for access control
- Implement dashboard as `/dashboard/[role]` structure
- Use `useRouter` and `redirect()` for automatic role-based routing
- Leverage Server Components for initial data fetching
- Use Client Components for interactive dashboard widgets

**Decision**: Implement dashboards using App Router with dynamic routes and middleware-based access control.

**Rationale**: Aligns with Next.js 15 best practices, enables server-side rendering, and provides clean URL structure.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single-page dashboard with client-side routing: Rejected due to SEO and initial load performance issues
- API-based role detection: Rejected due to unnecessary round trips

### 2. Role-Based Access Control in NextAuth.js
**Question**: How to implement role-based routing and component visibility with NextAuth.js?

**Findings**:
- Extend NextAuth session with role information
- Use middleware.ts for route protection
- Implement role-based component rendering with conditional logic
- Store roles in JWT token for client-side access

**Decision**: Extend NextAuth session with user roles and implement middleware-based route protection.

**Rationale**: Leverages existing authentication infrastructure and provides secure, performant access control.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database queries on each request: Rejected due to performance overhead
- Client-side only role checking: Rejected due to security vulnerabilities

### 3. Dashboard State Management with Zustand
**Question**: How to manage dashboard-specific state (filters, preferences, real-time data) with Zustand?

**Findings**:
- Create separate stores for each dashboard type
- Use persistent storage for user preferences
- Implement real-time data synchronization patterns
- Leverage Zustand middleware for logging and debugging

**Decision**: Create role-specific Zustand stores with persistence and real-time capabilities.

**Rationale**: Provides scalable state management aligned with project constitution requirements.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux: Rejected due to complexity and bundle size
- React Context: Rejected due to re-rendering performance issues

### 4. Responsive Dashboard Layout Patterns
**Question**: What are modern responsive dashboard layout patterns for real estate platforms?

**Findings**:
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui Card components for widget containers
- Implement collapsible sidebars for mobile navigation

**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with shadcn/ui components and CSS Grid layouts.

**Rationale**: Ensures accessibility across devices and aligns with modern web standards.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed-width layouts: Rejected due to poor mobile experience
- Third-party dashboard libraries: Rejected due to bundle size and customization needs

### 5. Dashboard Performance Optimization
**Question**: How to optimize dashboard loading and interaction performance?

**Findings**:
- Implement code splitting by dashboard type
- Use React.lazy() for component loading
- Pre-fetch critical dashboard data
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use Next.js Image optimization for property images

**Decision**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and data pre-fetching strategies.

**Rationale**: Ensures <2s page load time performance goal is met.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single bundle approach: Rejected due to initial load time
- Client-side data fetching only: Rejected due to perceived performance

## Technical Approach Summary

**Architecture**: Next.js App Router with role-based dynamic routes, middleware authentication, Zustand state management, and responsive shadcn/ui components.

**Key Patterns**:
- Route-based access control with middleware
- Server/Client component split for optimal performance
- Role-specific stores and components
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Code splitting and lazy loading

**Performance Strategy**: Server-side rendering for initial load, client-side navigation, optimized images, and progressive enhancement.

**Security Approach**: JWT-based role validation, middleware protection, and secure API endpoints.
