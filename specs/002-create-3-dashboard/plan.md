## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implementation plan for creating 3 role-based dashboard pages (administrator, agent, user) in Next.js 15 with App Router. Features include automatic role-based routing, personalized dashboard content, responsive design, and secure access control using NextAuth.js and middleware. Technical approach leverages shadcn/ui components, Zustand state management, and follows constitutional requirements for local development compatibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (ES2022), Go (backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15 (App Router), shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS, Zustand, NextAuth.js  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (backend), Redis (cache)  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design)  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load time, <100ms dashboard switching  
**Constraints**: Must work on mobile devices, role-based access control, consistent UI/UX  
**Scale/Scope**: 3 dashboard types, role-based routing, personalized content

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Compliance Status**: PASS - All requirements met
- ✅ Next.js App Router framework
- ✅ TypeScript language
- ✅ shadcn/ui components (no Radix or unapproved UI libraries)
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling
- ✅ Zustand state management
- ✅ Web application structure (frontend + backend)
- ✅ Role-based access control aligns with security principles
- ✅ Responsive design supports mobile devices
- ✅ Local development compatibility (Docker containers)

**No violations detected** - Feature implementation can proceed following constitutional guidelines.

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate frontend (Next.js) and backend (Go) domains. Dashboard pages will be implemented in the frontend using Next.js App Router with role-based routing. Shared components and utilities will be placed in appropriate lib/ and components/ directories.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract endpoint → contract test task [P] (parallel)
- Each dashboard entity → model/component creation task [P]
- Each user story scenario → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make contract tests pass
- Authentication and middleware setup tasks
- UI component development tasks for each dashboard type

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Authentication → middleware → data models → API routes → UI components
- Parallel execution [P] for independent components (admin/agent/user dashboards)
- Sequential for shared dependencies (auth, middleware, base components)

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md including:
- 6 contract test tasks (one per API endpoint)
- 9 UI component tasks (3 dashboards × 3 main components each)
- 6 API implementation tasks (dashboard data, metrics, user management)
- 4 authentication/middleware tasks
- 8 integration test tasks (from user scenarios)
- 4 validation tasks (performance, security, accessibility)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
