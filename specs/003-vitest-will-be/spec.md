# Feature Specification: Vitest as Default Testing Framework

**Feature Branch**: `003-vitest-will-be`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Vitest will be the default testing for everything frontend."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: What is the preferred migration strategy for existing frontend tests? ‚Üí A: Vitest for frontend, else GoLang.
- Q: How should Vitest integrate with the existing CI/CD pipeline? ‚Üí A: Use Vitest only for frontend-specific CI/CD stages.
- Q: What test coverage tool should be used with Vitest? ‚Üí A: Use Vitest's built-in coverage (v8)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend developer, I want Vitest to be the default testing framework for all frontend development so that testing is consistent, fast, and efficient across the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new frontend component is created, **When** a developer writes tests, **Then** Vitest is used as the default testing framework.
2. **Given** the project is set up for testing, **When** the test command is run, **Then** Vitest executes all tests.
3. **Given** existing tests in the project, **When** they are migrated, **Then** they work with Vitest.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing tests use a different framework like Jest? Use Vitest for frontend, else GoLang.
- How does this affect CI/CD pipelines? Use Vitest only for frontend-specific CI/CD stages.
- What about test coverage reporting? Use Vitest's built-in coverage (v8)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: All frontend tests MUST use Vitest as the testing framework
- **FR-002**: Project configuration MUST be set to use Vitest by default
- **FR-003**: Development documentation MUST specify Vitest as the default testing framework
- **FR-004**: Test scripts in package.json MUST use Vitest commands
- **FR-005**: Test files MUST follow Vitest conventions and syntax
