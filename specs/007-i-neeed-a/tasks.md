# Tasks: Logout Button in Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-i-neeed-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are optional and not requested in the feature specification - no test tasks included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `espasyo-frontend/src/`, `espasyo-backend/`
- Paths based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

No setup tasks required - project structure already exists and authentication is configured.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

No foundational tasks required - Next.js 15, NextAuth.js 5.x, and shadcn/ui are already configured and functional.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Logs Out from Dashboard (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Provide authenticated users with a logout button in the dashboard that securely terminates their session and redirects to the login page.

**Independent Test**: Access dashboard as authenticated user, click logout button, verify immediate logout without confirmation, redirect to login page, and inability to access protected pages without re-authentication.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T001 [P] [US1] Create logout button component with loading state and logout logic in `espasyo-frontend/src/components/dashboard/logout-button.tsx`
- [ ] T002 [P] [US1] Update dashboard page to include logout button in header in `espasyo-frontend/src/pages/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] T003 [US1] Optional: Add server-side logout endpoint for enhanced token invalidation in `espasyo-frontend/src/pages/api/auth/logout.ts`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently - users can logout from dashboard without confirmation and be redirected to login page.

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect the user story

- [ ] T004 [US1] Add proper error handling for logout failures in logout button component
- [ ] T005 [US1] Ensure logout button is accessible and follows design system guidelines
- [ ] T006 [US1] Test logout functionality across different browsers and devices

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - already complete
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: No dependencies - already complete
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: Can start immediately
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately

### Within Each User Story

- T001 and T002 can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- T003 is optional and can be implemented after T001/T002
- Polish tasks can be done after core functionality

### Parallel Opportunities

- T001 and T002 can run in parallel by different developers
- All polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Developer A works on logout button component:
Task: "Create logout button component with loading state and logout logic in espasyo-frontend/src/components/dashboard/logout-button.tsx"

# Developer B works on dashboard integration:
Task: "Update dashboard page to include logout button in header in espasyo-frontend/src/pages/dashboard/page.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T001 + T002)
2. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test logout functionality independently
3. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete User Story 1 core functionality (T001 + T002)
2. Add optional server-side logout (T003)
3. Add polish and error handling (T004 + T005 + T006)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Developer A: Create logout button component (T001)
2. Developer B: Update dashboard page (T002)
3. Both complete ‚Üí Test integration ‚Üí Add polish tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US1] label maps all tasks to User Story 1
- User Story 1 is independently completable and testable
- Optional server-side logout (T003) can be deferred if client-side logout suffices
- Commit after each task completion
- Stop at checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid cross-story dependencies (only one story in this feature)
