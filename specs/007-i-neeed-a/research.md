**Status**: Complete - No research required

## Research Tasks

No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers were identified in the specification, so no research tasks were generated.

## Findings

All technical decisions were resolved during the clarification phase:

- **Session Termination**: Server-side token invalidation + client-side cleanup
- **Redirect Destination**: Application's login page
- **User Confirmation**: No confirmation dialog required

## Technology Assessment

**Frontend**: Next.js 15 with NextAuth.js 5.x - standard logout functionality available  
**Backend**: Go microservices with JWT - token invalidation patterns established  
**Security**: OAuth integration requires proper token cleanup

## Recommendations

Proceed with implementation using established patterns. No additional research needed.
