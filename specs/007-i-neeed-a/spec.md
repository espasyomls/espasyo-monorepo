## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: How should the logout process terminate the user's session? → A: Server-side logout (invalidate tokens on server) + client-side cleanup (clear local storage/cookies)
- Q: What should be the redirect destination after logout? → A: Application's login page
- Q: Should the logout button require user confirmation before proceeding? → A: No, logout immediately on button click

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Logs Out from Dashboard (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user viewing the dashboard, I want to be able to log out so that I can securely end my session and prevent unauthorized access to my account.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested - providing a secure way to end user sessions from the main application interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the dashboard, clicking the logout button, and verifying the user is redirected to the login page and cannot access protected content without re-authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in and viewing the dashboard, **When** they click the logout button, **Then** they are logged out immediately without confirmation and redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a user is logged in and viewing the dashboard, **When** they click the logout button, **Then** their session is terminated and they cannot access protected pages without logging in again

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user clicks logout multiple times quickly?
- How does the system handle logout during an active operation (like saving data)?
- What happens if the logout request fails due to network issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-002**: System MUST invalidate authentication tokens server-side and clear client-side storage (local storage/cookies) when the logout button is clicked
- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect users to the login page after successful logout
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent access to protected pages after logout without re-authentication
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback when logout is in progress

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User Session**: Represents the authenticated state of a user, including session identifier, authentication tokens, and expiration. Supports server-side invalidation and client-side cleanup.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of authenticated users can successfully log out from the dashboard within 3 seconds of clicking the logout button
- **SC-002**: Users cannot access dashboard or other protected pages after logout without re-authenticating
- **SC-003**: System maintains security by properly terminating sessions and clearing authentication tokens
- **SC-004**: Logout functionality works reliably across different browsers and devices
