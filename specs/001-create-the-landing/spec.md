## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What should happen when a user who is already logged in visits the landing page? ‚Üí A: Replace buttons with a logout option
- Q: What authentication method should be used for login and registration? ‚Üí A: Google OAuth only
- Q: What accessibility requirements should the login and registration modals meet? ‚Üí A: must be optimized for mobile

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to the EspasyoMLS website, I want to view an engaging landing page inspired by housesigma.com, so that I can learn about the platform and easily access options to log in or register for an account.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the website's root URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a landing page with content inspired by housesigma.com, including property listings, search features, and platform information.
2. **Given** the landing page is displayed, **When** the user clicks the subtle login button in the header, **Then** a shadcn/ui modal interface opens allowing them to enter login credentials.
3. **Given** the landing page is displayed, **When** the user clicks the subtle registration button in the header, **Then** a shadcn/ui modal interface opens allowing them to create a new account.

### Edge Cases
- When the user is already logged in and visits the landing page, the header should replace login and registration buttons with a logout option.
- The login and registration modals must be optimized for mobile to handle users with disabilities.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a landing page with content inspired by housesigma.com, including: a hero section with property search bar, grid of featured property listings with images and key details (price, location, beds/baths), clean professional layout with navigation header, and responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile.
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a header with small, subtle login and registration buttons.
- **FR-003**: System MUST open a shadcn/ui user interface modal for Google OAuth login when the login button is clicked.
- **FR-004**: System MUST open a shadcn/ui user interface modal for Google OAuth registration when the registration button is clicked.
