- TailwindCSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- NextAuth.js for Google OAuth
- React Hook Form for form handling

## Architecture Decisions
- Client-side rendering for interactive elements
- Static generation for performance

- Separation of concerns between UI and business logic

## Risks and Considerations
- OAuth configuration complexity
- Mobile performance optimization
- Image loading and optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Conclusion
The landing page can be implemented using the established tech stack with shadcn/ui providing consistent, accessible components. Google OAuth integration will require proper configuration, and mobile optimization must be prioritized throughout development.</content>
