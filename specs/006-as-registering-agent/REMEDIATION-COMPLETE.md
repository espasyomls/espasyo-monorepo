## Remediation Actions Completed

### CRITICAL Issues (8) - ✅ ALL RESOLVED

| ID | Issue | Resolution | Files Modified |
|----|-------|------------|----------------|
| **D1** | Duplicate task sets in tasks.md (T001-T073 vs T010-T037 legacy) | Deleted legacy tasks (lines 802-1192), kept only revised set | `tasks.md` |

| **T1** | Terminology drift (profile naming) | Added Terminology glossary section standardizing: agent profile, Personal Profile, AgentProfile | `spec.md` |
| **T2** | Terminology drift (verification naming) | Standardized: verification application (noun), verification flow (process), submit verification (verb) | `spec.md` |
| **C6** | Required vs optional profile fields unclear | Added explicit list to T011: Required (7 fields), Optional (2 fields) | `tasks.md` |
| **C7** | Edge cases lack task coverage | Added edge case coverage matrix to tasks.md, 11 of 14 covered, 3 out of scope documented | `tasks.md` |

### LOW Priority Issues (2) - ✅ ALL RESOLVED

| ID | Issue | Resolution | Files Modified |
|----|-------|------------|----------------|
| **U3** | Public profile URL pattern unspecified | Specified: `/agents/[agentId]` (UUID), optional slug `/agents/[agentId]/[name-slug]` for SEO | `spec.md` |
| **U4** | "Hide or disable" ambiguous | Clarified: DISABLE buttons with tooltip (better UX than hiding) | `spec.md` |
