# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Registration and Verification Flow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been successfully validated. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive user stories with clear prioritization (P1/P2)
- Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- 52 detailed functional requirements organized by domain (Auth, Dashboard, Verification, Access Control, Public Directory)
- 12 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Extensive edge case coverage (12 scenarios identified)
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- Comprehensive assumptions documented

### Notes

The specification successfully avoids implementation details and maintains a technology-agnostic approach. All requirements are testable and unambiguous. The feature is well-scoped with clear success criteria that can be independently measured.

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
