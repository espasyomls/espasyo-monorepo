# Research Findings: Progressive Agent Verification Flow

## Phase 0 Research Tasks Completed

### 1. OAuth 2.0 Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use NextAuth.js with Google OAuth provider
**Rationale**: NextAuth.js is already in the tech stack and provides robust OAuth 2.0 implementation with built-in security features, session management, and error handling.
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom OAuth implementation (rejected due to security risks), Auth0 (rejected due to additional cost and complexity)

### 2. Progressive Form State Management
**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zustand for complex multi-step forms
**Rationale**: React Hook Form provides excellent performance and validation, while Zustand offers lightweight state management for draft persistence across sessions.
**Alternatives Considered**: Formik (rejected due to bundle size), Redux (rejected due to complexity for this use case)

### 3. File Upload Security
**Decision**: Client-side validation with file type/size restrictions, server-side validation with virus scanning
**Rationale**: Multi-layer validation ensures security while maintaining good UX. File type restrictions prevent malicious uploads.
**Alternatives Considered**: No client-side validation (rejected due to poor UX), third-party upload services (rejected due to cost)

### 4. Status Tracking Architecture
**Decision**: Database-backed status tracking with enum validation
**Rationale**: Ensures data integrity and allows for complex status transitions. Enum validation prevents invalid states.
**Alternatives Considered**: File-based status (rejected due to concurrency issues), in-memory only (rejected due to persistence requirements)

### 5. Draft Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: 30-day automatic cleanup with user notification
**Rationale**: Balances user convenience with data management. Notification ensures users are aware of impending deletion.
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual cleanup only (rejected due to storage bloat), indefinite retention (rejected due to privacy concerns)

### 6. Admin Review Workflow
**Decision**: Role-based access with audit logging
**Rationale**: Ensures accountability and prevents unauthorized access. Audit logs provide compliance and debugging capabilities.
**Alternatives Considered**: Open access (rejected due to security), email-based workflow (rejected due to lack of tracking)

### 7. Error Handling Patterns
**Decision**: User-friendly error messages with retry mechanisms
**Rationale**: Improves user experience while maintaining security. Retry mechanisms handle transient failures gracefully.
**Alternatives Considered**: Technical error messages (rejected due to poor UX), no retry (rejected due to reliability issues)

### 8. Data Retention Compliance
**Decision**: 1-year retention for submitted applications with encryption
**Rationale**: Meets business needs while addressing privacy requirements. Encryption ensures data protection.
**Alternatives Considered**: Shorter retention (rejected due to business needs), longer retention (rejected due to privacy risks)

## Technical Approach Summary

**Frontend Architecture**:
- Next.js 15 App Router for routing and API routes
- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

**Authentication & Security**:
- NextAuth.js for OAuth 2.0 with Google
- Minimal data collection (email only)
- Secure session management

**State Management**:
- Zustand for client-side state
- React Hook Form for form management
- Local storage for draft persistence

**API Design**:
- RESTful endpoints following Next.js conventions
- Proper error handling and validation
- File upload with security measures

**Data Management**:
- Status lifecycle enforcement
- Automatic cleanup policies
- Audit logging for admin actions

**Testing Strategy**:
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Contract tests for API validation
- E2E tests for critical user flows
