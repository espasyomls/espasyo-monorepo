# Feature Specification: Progressive Agent Verification Flow

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to change this flow. As Registering Agent, I want to be able to use my Gmail and authenticate. After successful authentication, I will see my dashboard. In my agent dashboard, I will be able to click "Verify Me" tab. In this tab is where I will be doing the step by step until I am able to submit for Administrator verification. The value for doing this is that, as Agent, I can save the step where I am and come back later until I have all the documents required for the verification process. Doing this manner will also allow for the administrator to send back the verification application to me if there are more documents that the administrator requires."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a registering real estate agent, I want to authenticate using my Gmail account, access my dashboard immediately, and complete my verification progressively through a "Verify Me" tab where I can save my progress and return later, so that I can gather all required documents over time and submit for administrator review, which allows administrators to request additional documents if needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an agent has a Gmail account, **When** they authenticate successfully, **Then** they are redirected to their dashboard without going through a one-time onboarding wizard
2. **Given** an agent is on their dashboard, **When** they click the "Verify Me" tab, **Then** they see a step-by-step verification form
3. **Given** an agent is filling out verification steps, **When** they save their progress, **Then** their current step data is preserved and they can return later to continue
4. **Given** an agent has completed all verification steps, **When** they submit for review, **Then** their application is sent to administrators for approval
5. **Given** an administrator reviews an agent's application, **When** they determine additional documents are needed, **Then** they can send the application back with specific document requirements
6. **Given** an agent receives feedback requiring additional documents, **When** they access their "Verify Me" tab, **Then** they see the specific requirements and can upload the additional documents

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent starts verification but doesn't complete it within 30 days?
- How does the system handle multiple verification attempts by the same agent?
- What happens if an agent tries to submit incomplete verification?
- How are verification drafts protected during the 30-day retention period?
- What happens if an administrator requests documents that the agent cannot provide?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow agents to authenticate using Gmail credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect authenticated agents directly to their dashboard
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a "Verify Me" tab in the agent dashboard
- **FR-004**: System MUST present verification as a step-by-step process within the "Verify Me" tab
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow agents to save their current verification progress as drafts
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow agents to resume verification from their last saved step
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow agents to submit completed verification applications for administrator review
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow administrators to approve verification applications
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow administrators to reject verification applications
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow administrators to request additional documents from agents
- **FR-011**: System MUST notify agents when their application status changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST display current verification status to agents in their dashboard
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide administrators with full access to view all agent verification applications
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow administrators to approve verification applications
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow administrators to reject verification applications
- **FR-018**: System MUST track verification application status through the complete lifecycle: not_started ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí returned ‚Üí approved/rejected
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow applications to transition from submitted to returned status when additional documents are requested
- **FR-021**: System MUST handle Gmail authentication failures by showing a generic error message and allowing retry

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent**: Real estate professional seeking verification (attributes: Gmail account, personal info, license details, service areas)
- **Verification Application**: Agent's submission for review (attributes: status with lifecycle not_started ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí returned ‚Üí approved/rejected, submitted documents, review notes, additional requirements)
- **Verification Step**: Individual component of the verification process (attributes: step type, completion status, saved data)
- **Administrator**: System user who reviews agent applications (attributes: review permissions, feedback capabilities, full access to all applications)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST implement basic OAuth 2.0 authentication with Gmail, collecting only email access for agent identification
- **NFR-002**: System MUST minimize data collection to essential verification information only
- **NFR-003**: System MUST retain verification drafts for 30 days before automatic deletion
- **NFR-004**: System MUST retain submitted verification applications for 1 year
